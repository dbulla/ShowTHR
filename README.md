# ShowTHR

Read a THR file and simulate the motion of a ball rolling over a table covered in sand.

This is a fork of [ShowTHR](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/ShowTHR) with some major changes:
- Migrated build system from Maven to Gradle (hey, I like Gradle :) )
- Migrated from Java to Kotlin (I _really_ like Kotlin)
- 2-ball simulations
- Reverse-order track
- Use a background image for the initial sand depth (i.e., like having done a "clean" before the track)
- Real-time simulation â€” like watching the table itself draw
- Make an .mp4 of the track's movement
- Draw multiple, consecutive tracks (i.e., each track overwrites the previous) - and again, can make an .mp4 of this

### **Typical usage:**

- Build and run from Gradle: 
  - `./gradlew run  --args="-i clockworkSwirl5WithClipping.thr`
  - if `-tableSize` is not specified, the screen size will be used

- Run from Java:
  - First, build the jar: 
    - `./gradlew shadowJar`

  - Then run the jar: 
    - `java -jar build/libs/ShowTHR-all.jar -i clockworkSwirl5WithClipping.thr`

- Make an animation (output 1000x1000 pixels, sped up): 
  - `./gradlew run --args="-makeAnimation -tableSize 1000 -i offset_spiral_2.thr -skip 1600`

- Make an animation of multiple tracks playing (outout 1000x1000 pixels): 
  - `./gradlew run --args="-makeAnimation -tableSize 1000 -batchTracks offset_spiral_2,clean,dougsSpiralTriangle2,clean,Broken_Wings,clean -skip 1600`

|--------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -2balls            | Two balls are better than one! | If your table has the ability to use 2 balls, this simulates that                                                                                                                              |

Get the [Release](https://github.com/douglasbullard/ShowTHR/releases) version or build it yourself from source code.


## Example

```java -jar ShowTHR.jar "src/test/resources/Vaporeon with Waves.thr" sand_simulation.png -w 1000 -h 1000```

should produce the following:

![Example](testTracks/sand_simulation.png)

## Notes

The intensity of the output image is dictated by the highest peak in the sand simulation.  The output image is normalized to the range [0, 255].
If one point of sand is very tall, the rest of the image will be very dark.
